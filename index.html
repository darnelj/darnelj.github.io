    <p>
      My name is Darnel Joseph and I am plotting to take over what was once
      known as the "tech industry". Okay, take over might be a bit of a stretch.
      I do have technological goals though. I'm really interested in mobile apps
      because of the influence they have on people of my generation and others
      alike.

      I currently live in South Florida. My father lives in Brooklyn, New York around East Flatbush
      I've been traveling back and forth between florida and New York for the past few summers.

      I arrived to the Google office about thirty minutes earlier than our scheduled start time. Being the first one there, I was greeted by Johnny who came in second after me.
      Then a few more interesting characters came: Billy, Marisa, Caroline T. and others I'm sure I'll get to know later on.
      The tour of the google office has been amazing thus far and I'm really excited to spend three weeks here.
      My instructors and advisors seem very helpful and interested in making sure I understand and know the material.
